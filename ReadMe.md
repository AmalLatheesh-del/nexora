Prompt:
  Build a modern, responsive Personal Command Center website that helps me manage and simplify my daily life.
  The site should include:
  Dashboard/Homepage showing an overview of my day — time, date, weather, and quick access to tools.
  Task Manager to add, edit, and check off to-do items (stored locally or synced with Google Drive/Firebase).
  Calendar View connected to Google Calendar (optional integration).
  Notes/Journal Section with markdown support and cloud saving.
  Quick Launch Area for favorite websites/apps (e.g., Gmail, YouTube, ChatGPT).
  Motivational or focus section — show a daily quote, focus timer, or ambient sound controls.
  
  Design Requirements:
  Clean, minimal, and futuristic interface (like Apple or Notion style).
  Use a light/dark mode toggle.
  Include smooth animations and transitions (Framer Motion or CSS).
  Mobile-friendly layout (responsive grid or flexbox).
  
  Technical Details:
  Frontend: React (with Tailwind CSS) or Flutter Web.
  Optional backend: Firebase (for authentication and data sync).
  Use modular components: Navbar, Dashboard, Tasks, Notes, Settings.
  Save data locally with browser storage if user not logged in.
  Goal: Create an elegant, personal hub that centralizes all my daily productivity tools in one place — simple, fast, and motivating to use every day
